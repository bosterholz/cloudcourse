## Workflow managment systems

### What have we done so far?

Last time we set up our own instance in the de.NBI cloud.
We created volumes and mounted them to get a mean to store our data in a persistant fashion.
The Openstack CLI was installed and used to get access to the cloud object storage, another means to store data in the cloud.
At the end we used the bibigrid tool to set up our own compute cluster.
This is where we want to continue today and use the newly started cluster to test different workflow managment systems.

### Nextflow

The first candidate we will test is called [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/). If you have questions or are stuck during the execises, just look
at the [documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html). The documentation is well written and can solve many questions quickly.
